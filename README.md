# Procedure
1. Place the optical breadboard on a flat table surface.  
2. Fix the cylindrical head of the He-Ne laser source onto the breadboard securely.  
3. Mount the laser to the fiber coupler with its base plate oriented toward the laser exit.  
4. Switch on the He-Ne laser and align the beam spot centrally on the coupling lens assembly. Tighten screws.  
5. Check for back reflection from the rod lens of the coupler. Adjust screws until the reflected spot aligns with the laser exit.  
6. Confirm central alignment using a white card sheet. Adjust screws if the spot is off-center.  
7. Connect the multimode optical patch cord to the coupler and secure the other end in the fiber holding stand.  
8. Observe the bright laser spot exiting the fiber. Adjust fiber tip height to ~50 mm above the paper sheet.  
9. View the multimode speckle pattern on the screen. Adjust screws to refine the pattern. Replace with single mode fiber.  
10. For single mode fiber, observe blur patterns with lobes (two, three, or four) by fine-tuning the coupler screws.

# Observation and Calculation
Parameters of given fiber:  
- Core radius \(A = 4.5 \, \mu m\)  
- Numerical Aperture \(NA = 0.11\)  
- Wavelength \(\lambda = 633 \, nm\)  

\[
V = \frac{2 \pi \cdot A \cdot NA}{\lambda} = 4.91
\]

- From the figure, only **4 LP modes** propagate.  
- Total number of modes:  

\[
\frac{V^2}{2} = \frac{(4.91)^2}{2} \approx 12.05
\]

# Result
The fiber supports **4 Linearly Polarized (LP) modes** at the given parameters.
